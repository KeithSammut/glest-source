**This is the game engine source code repository.**

[Glest](https://glest.github.io/docs/) is a fork of [Glest](http://glest.org/),
a libre software cross platform real-time strategy game.

Glest is a network multi-player real-time strategy game engine.
It's shipped with the FactionPack mod, which includes several factions,
each one consisting of many 3d characters. The factions are loosely
based on historical empires with added elements of fantasy, such as
mummies produced by Egyptian priests, Indian shamans who summon
thunderbirds for air assaults, and Norsemen who can build flying
valkries and "Thors". Start the game by harvesting natural resources,
then use the cash to produce an army. Single-player mode against the
CPU is also available.

## Why this fork? (Project Goals)

Because we love Glest! We wanted to take the project into a
slightly different direction, and therefore we forked Glest into
the Glest project.

## FAQ

The FAQ is located at
[https://glest.github.io/docs/faq.html](https://glest.github.io/docs/faq.html).

## Download executable files

On Windows, the easiest way to get started is to [download and run the
installer](https://github.com/Glest/windows-installer). If you want
to contribute with the code on Windows, [please follow these
instructions](https://github.com/Glest/glest-source/blob/develop/mk/windows/README.md).

For other operating systems, you must [**build and install from
source**](https://github.com/Glest/glest-source/blob/develop/BUILD.md)
(Later, we'll be providing binary packages).

(The ETA for the first official release can be viewed from the [development
milestone](https://github.com/Glest/glest-source/milestone/1).)

## Running

    ./glest (if you didn't install)

OR

    glest (if you installed and the binary is in your PATH)

To run your own headless (dedicated) server, see [the FAQ](https://glest.github.io/docs/faq.html#headlessserver).
