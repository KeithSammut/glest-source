# Glest

**Official Website: https://glest.io**

[Glest](https://glest.io) is a network multi-player real-time strategy game engine.
It includes several factions, each one consisting of many 3d characters. The factions are loosely
based on historical empires with added elements of fantasy, such as
mummies produced by Egyptian priests, shamans who summon
thunderbirds for air assaults, and Norsemen who can build flying
valkries and "Thors". Start the game by harvesting natural resources,
then use the cash to produce an army. Single-player mode against the
CPU is also available.
